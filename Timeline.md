# Leads Wizard Development Timeline

#### Day 1-2: Initial Development
- I experiment with making a custom GPT, **"Social Media Wizard"**, to assist in responding to inbound queries on a social media management platform.
- I started with a manual Google Keep clipboard system to reduce workflow complexity.

#### Day 3: Fine-Tuning Prompts
- I refined the Wizard to improve its responsiveness and accuracy.

#### Day 12: Strategic Planning and Updates
- After discussions with stakeholders, I documented feedback, aligned long-term strategies for sales and growth, and updated the Wizard to reflect these considerations.

#### Day 15: Rebranding and Knowledge Integration
- I rebranded the tool as the **"Leads Wizard"** with a professional new logo. I added detailed service information and external knowledge integration with manually curated FSL.

#### Day 16-17: Personalization and Lead Scoring
- I developed a **dynamic lead scoring system** and introduced an **"inner monologue"** for better decision-making. Bugs were identified and improvements outlined.

#### Day 22: Refining Knowledge Base
- I restructured FSL examples and core system prompts for improved domain information clarity and consistency.
  
#### Day 25-27: Empathy and Engagement Enhancements
- I integrated dynamic lead scoring systems, refined inner monologue CoT mechanisms for contextually aware product and service recommendations, and to improve conversation fluidity.
- LW now varied responses dynamically to increase engagement and novelty, and guided users toward meaningful interactions, including redirecting to company service platforms for further engagement.

#### Day 28: Modular Architecture
- I ideated & brainstormed different methods for dynamic information retrieval and deposition, and conceptualized "Context Containers" as fluid but uniform data schemas.
- I discussed and learned further LLM limitations with technical leadership to understand strategic implementation vs iterative improvements to LW.
- I reorganized knowledge base data into modular schema with scalability in mind.

#### Day 34: Completion of First prototype
- After feedback from stakeholders and collaboration with sales, marketing and growth teams, I refined the entire workflow of LW to optimize lead response time and meet standards.
- LW now seamlessly combined tailored personalization, empathy, dynamic scoring, and integrated tools, recommendations and knowledge bases.

#### Day 42-46: API integration and Workflow Overhaul
- After discussions with executive & technical leadership, a streamlined version of LW is integrated into API workflows and adopted for cross-platform and multi-team automation.
