## Dataset used
(Data handling, Privacy and Bias management)

  Figure 4 - Interactive Dataset Visualizer - Each circle represents a conversation with a unique ID and attributes. Feel free to interact further:

</p> </i>

 - The dataset used was from a real-world startup, with 250+ datapoints (conversations with leads).
 - In light of maintaining privacy and protecting proprietary information, all data was anonymized and meta-labeled first. Each conversation maintains the unique conversation ID generated during the process of downloading using the extension, and maintains transparency.
 - The dataset was downloaded with LW-Chrome-Extension and manually labelled with Meta-Labeler (Both are open-source tools). Despite following strict labelling protocols and blinded cross-testing, it's important to note that manual labeling inherently adds bias to the data. Therefore the metrics above are a pilot scale proof of concept which can easily be automated moving forward to mitigate manual biases.
